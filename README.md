# Chat-with-PDF-using-AI-n8n-Workflow
This n8n workflow allows users to upload a PDF file (from Google Drive), chunk it into vectorized text segments using embeddings (Google Gemini), store them in a Pinecone vector store, and then query the document via natural language. The workflow returns AI-generated answers along with source citations.
